    <h1>Hi! Welcome to my getting into tech journey</h1>

    <p>This is a place where I will be sharing my own journey and experiences. The good ones, not so good, and the hardest ones.</p>

    <p>One of the things that I enjoy the most is to help others and I'm sure (at least I hope) that I get to help and support at least one person in the journay of getting into tech!</p>

    <p>I will be sharing different topics related in somehow to my journey.</p>
